# Handover Document: Family Vacation Planning Webpage
## From Claude (Sonnet 4.5) to Claude Code

**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Project:** Interactive family vacation planning webpage for Winter Break 2025  
**Client:** Family of 4 planning December vacation (Palo Alto, Berkeley, DC)

---

## Project Overview

I've been working with the client to research and plan a family vacation for December 14-21, 2025. The family needs to choose between 4 destinations:
1. **Baja California Sur** (Todos Santos, whale shark swimming, glamping)
2. **Southwest USA** (Arizona/New Mexico, hiking, cultural sites)
3. **Oaxaca, Mexico** (UNESCO heritage, food culture, indigenous arts)
4. **Tulum, Mexico** (Mayan ruins, cenotes, beaches)

I've created an interactive HTML webpage to help them compare options and vote. Now they want you to enhance it with:
1. **Softer, Google Material Design 3 colors** (light, subtle palette)
2. **Real images** fetched via image search API
3. **Accurate, verified links** to all tour operators, hotels, and resources using web search

---

## Current Code Location

The complete HTML webpage is in the **artifacts panel** of this conversation, titled:
**"Winter Break 2025 - Family Vacation Planning"**

You can access it by:
1. Looking at the artifacts panel on the right side of the screen
2. Finding the artifact named "Winter Break 2025 - Family Vacation Planning"
3. The artifact ID is: `family_vacation_webpage`

The code is a **single HTML file** with embedded CSS and JavaScript - completely self-contained.

## What Needs to Be Done

### 1. Color Scheme Update (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Problem:** Current colors are too bold and saturated  
**Goal:** Make it look like a Google app - soft, subtle, light colors

**Target Palette (Google Material Design 3 style):**
```css
/* Replace current colors with: */
:root {
    --primary: #1E88E5;           /* Soft blue, not dark purple */
    --primary-light: #E3F2FD;     /* Very light blue */
    --surface: #FFFFFF;           /* Pure white */
    --surface-variant: #F5F5F5;   /* Light gray */
    --on-surface: #202124;        /* Dark gray for text */
    --on-surface-variant: #5F6368; /* Medium gray */
    --outline: #DADCE0;           /* Light border gray */
    --success: #34A853;           /* Google green */
    --warning: #FBBC04;           /* Google yellow */
    --error: #EA4335;             /* Google red */
}
```

**References:**
- Google Calendar's color scheme
- Google Drive's interface
- Gmail's soft, minimal aesthetic

### 2. Image Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current State:** Image placeholders with text like "Search: whale sharks La Paz"

**What to build:**
```javascript
// For each image placeholder, fetch real images
// Suggested approach:

async function fetchImages() {
    // Use Unsplash API (free, no auth for limited use)
    // OR Pexels API (free with API key)
    // OR Google Custom Search JSON API
    
    const imageQueries = {
        baja: [
            'whale shark swimming La Paz Mexico',
            'sea lion snorkeling Espiritu Santo',
            'luxury glamping tent Baja desert',
            'Todos Santos Mexico colorful town'
        ],
        southwest: [
            'Saguaro National Park Arizona sunset',
            'Santa Fe adobe architecture',
            'Taos Pueblo New Mexico',
            'Southwest cooking class'
        ],
        oaxaca: [
            'Monte Alban ruins Oaxaca sunset',
            'Oaxacan cooking class traditional',
            'Sierra Norte cloud forest Mexico',
            'Teotitlan del Valle weaving loom'
        ],
        tulum: [
            'Tulum ruins Caribbean cliff aerial',
            'cenote swimming Mexico underground',
            'Coba pyramid Mayan ruins',
            'Sian Kaan mangrove Mexico'
        ]
    };
    
    // Fetch and populate images
    // Add attribution links back to source
}
```

   - High-quality travel photos
   - Attribution required (add photo credit)

2. **Pexels**: https://www.pexels.com/api/

   - Good travel photo collection
   - Attribution appreciated

3. **Pixabay**: https://pixabay.com/api/docs/

**Image Card Structure:**

    <div class="image-credit">
        Photo by <a href="[photographer-url]">[photographer]</a> 
        on <a href="[source]">[platform]</a>
    </div>
</div>
```

### 3. Link Verification & Updates (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Links Already Verified (from my research):**
- **TOSEA**: https://tosea.net/ (main site)
- **TOSEA email**: tsecoadventures@gmail.com
- **TOSEA phone**: +1-619-446-6827
- **AdventureSmith**: https://adventuresmithexplorations.com/trips/baja/camp-cecil-adventure/
- **Baja Tours Mexico**: https://www.bajatoursmexico.com/

**Links That Need Verification:**
Use web search to verify current URLs for:

**Baja Section:**
- [ ] Los Colibris Casitas hotel website
- [ ] Camp Cecil booking page (may be through TOSEA)

**Southwest Section:**
- [ ] Backroads Arizona tours page
- [ ] Context Travel US tours page  
- [ ] Southwest Discoveries website
- [ ] Travel Dream West website
- [ ] Saguaro National Park official site

**Oaxaca Section:**
- [ ] Discover Oaxaca Tours (Benito & Suzanne)
- [ ] Coyote Aventuras website
- [ ] Journey Mexico Oaxaca itineraries

**Tulum Section:**
- [ ] Mexico Kan Tours
- [ ] Eating With Carmen food tours
- [ ] Tulum archaeological zone (INAH official)

**Process:**
```python
# For each link:
# 1. Search for "[company name] official website"
# 2. Verify it's the current URL (not outdated)
# 3. Check if booking/contact info is available
# 4. Update href in HTML
# 5. Add title attributes for accessibility
```

### 4. Additional Enhancements (OPTIONAL)

**Nice to have if time allows:**

**A. Responsive Image Loading**
```javascript
// Lazy load images as user scrolls
// Use Intersection Observer API
```

**B. Cost Calculator**
```javascript
// Interactive budget calculator
// Adjust family size, flight costs, etc.
```

**C. Comparison Export**
```javascript
// "Download as PDF" or "Email to family" button
// Generate formatted comparison document
```

**D. Voting Dashboard**
```javascript
// If multiple family members vote
// Show aggregated results
// Simple localStorage or Firebase integration
```

## Key Research Context

### Why Baja is Top Recommendation
1. Once-in-a-lifetime wildlife (whale sharks, sea lions)
2. Expert naturalist guides (PhD-level)
3. Cultural immersion with ranch families
4. Conversational activities (kayaking together)
5. December is PEAK season
6. Easier from CA (where 3 of 4 family members are based)
7. Luxury glamping (comfort + adventure)

### Budget Context
- Baja: $13k-21k total (family of 4)
- Southwest: $10k-18k
- Oaxaca: $9k-16k  
- Tulum: $11k-19k

## Questions to Resolve

**Q1: Image API Choice**  
Which API should we use? Recommend Unsplash for quality, but client may prefer Pexels (easier terms).

**Q2: Attribution Placement**  
Where should photo credits go? Overlay on image vs. caption below?

**Q3: Link Verification Depth**  
Should we verify ALL links work or just update the main ones?

**Q4: Booking Integration**  
Client mentioned Context Travel doesn't operate in Tulum - should we remove that link or note unavailability?

---

## Handoff Notes
